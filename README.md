Some ideas that may or may not one day become a game or something

## Concept

- Cookie Clicker + OGame
- Space-economy-themed idle scaling
- Procedurally generated galaxies

## Mechanics

- Time rate:
    - 1 myron (my) = 10 khrs = 10,000 hrs = 10000/8765.82 (~1.141) mean Earth yrs (mEyr)
        - 1 hemyron (hmy) = 0.5 myn = 5,000 hr = 5000/8765.82 (~0.5704) mEyr
    - 1 min/ms = 3,600,000 min/hr = 60,000 hr/hr = 6 my/hr = 144 my/day = 1008 my/wk
        - ~6.846 mEyr/hr, ~164.3 mEyr/day, ~1150 mEyr/wk
- Indefinite scaling
- Economy management
    - Resources
        - Mining
        - Spending
        - Transporting
    - Infrastructure
        - Meet citizenry's needs
    - Citizens
        - Fill jobs to enable production
            - Won't work if needs are not met
        - Education to increase work efficiency
- Research tree
    - Tech improves capabilities
    - -e^(-kx)+n scaling
- Ships
    - Transport goods/citizens between systems
    - Discovery expeditions
        - Alien life
        - Viable planets
        - New resources/tech
    - Colonize new planets
    - Raid hostile alien worlds
- Defenses (not as emphasized as OGame)
    - Defend against potential alien invaders
- Interspecies interactions
    - Discover new forms of life/civilizations
    - Form relationships
        - Friendly/Alliance
        - Hostile
- Species builder?

## Ideas

- Opening:
    - You are the last surivors of a dead civilization, on a colony ship seeking sanctuary and a new beginning... (start with a dead solar system that can be rehabilitated after a while, +toughness or something)
    - OR
    - You are the first colonization expedition out of a thriving empire, seeking to expand its horizons... (start with a functional solar system)
- Mining stations/rigs around gas giants
- Research tech
    - Propulsion: Combustion rocket -> Nuclear thermal rocket -> Impulse? -> 
    - Computation: 
    - Energy:
